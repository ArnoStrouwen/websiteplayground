Experimental Design often deals with small samples.
The statistical literature is filled with formulas for hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for various scenarios.
I often strugle with the exact assumptions behind the different tests.
For example, when to use ... and when to use ...?
For this reason, I have started a collection of simulation studies containing examples and counterexamples for common hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
